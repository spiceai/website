# Typography

We use Manrope as our primary font.

We use Roboto Mono as our monospace font.

### CVA - Class Variance Authority

We use CVA to create **variants** for our “Atoms”, which are our smallest components. Please refer to them later in the documentation.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use appropriate heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to maintain proper document structure.
- Maintain consistency in font sizes and weights across the application.
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability.
- Use bold and semibold weights sparingly to emphasize important information.
- For body text, stick to regular weight and a comfortable reading size (typically 16px).
