### What is Spice?

**Spice** is a portable runtime offering developers a unified SQL interface to materialize, accelerate, and query data from any database, data warehouse, or data lake.

ðŸ“£ Read the [Spice.ai OSS announcement blog post](https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2024/03/28/adding-spice-the-next-generation-of-spice.ai-oss/).

Spice connects, fuses, and delivers data to applications, machine-learning models, and AI-backends, functioning as an application-specific, tier-optimized Database CDN.

The Spice runtime, written in Rust, is built-with industry leading technologies such as [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org), Apache Arrow, Apache Arrow Flight, SQLite, and DuckDB.
